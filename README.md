# Student Portfolio Builder System

A desktop-based management system designed for students to organize, build, and sync their academic portfolios. Built with **Java Swing** and integrated with **MySQL** for persistent data management.

> **Note:** This project is currently in **Active Development**. Features are being added and refined as part of my BSIT-MWA coursework at National University.

## 🚀 Features
* **Secure Authentication**: Login and Registration system with credentials stored in MySQL.
* **Dynamic Dashboard**: Real-time greeting and course/year level display synced with user data.
* **Profile Synchronization**: Ability to update personal information (Full Name, Student ID, Email, Bio) and reflect changes instantly across the UI.
* **Slate & Ice UI**: A modern, professional interface using a light "Ice" background with "Slate" text and indigo accents.
* **Intelligent Custom Dialogs**: Custom-built `CustomDialog` system with dynamic Success (Indigo) and Error (Red) states.

## 🔒 Security & Validation
This version implements strict data integrity checks to ensure high-quality database entries:
* **Space Restriction**: Crtical fields like `Username`, `Password`, and `Student ID` block internal spaces to prevent credential errors.
* **Regex Email Validation**: Ensure email addressses follow the standard `user@domain.com` format.
* **Data Integrity**: Enforces specific formatting for Student IDs (numbers and dashes only).
* **Password Requirements**: Minimum length validation (8+ characters) to encourage secure user accounts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language**: Java
* **GUI Toolkit**: Java Swing
* **Database**: MySQL
* **Database Connectivity**: JDBC (MySQL Connector/J)
